All my tasks of [Object-Oriented Design Course - Alberta University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design).

## Content & Description

This course takes Java beginners to the next level by covering object-oriented analysis and design. You will discover how to create modular, flexible, and reusable software, by applying object-oriented design principles and guidelines. And, you will be able to communicate these designs in a visual notation known as Unified Modelling Language (UML).

You will be challenged in the Capstone Project to apply your knowledge of object-oriented design by evolving and documenting the Java codebase for an Android application with corresponding UML documentation.

## Benefits: 

• Apply the Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) technique to analyze and design the object-oriented model for a problem. 
• Explain and apply object-oriented modeling principles and their purpose (e.g., abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, generalization). 
• Explain and apply different types of inheritance.
• Explain the difference between association, aggregation, and composition dependencies. 
• Express object-oriented models as Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams. 
• Translate between UML class diagrams and equivalent Java code. 
• Apply design guidelines for modularity, separation of concerns, information hiding, and conceptual integrity to create a flexible, reusable, maintainable design. 
• Explain the tradeoff between cohesion and coupling.  
• Understand Object-Oriented Design.
• Understand Object-Oriented Analysis And Design.
• Understand Unified Modeling Language (UML).
